# Unity2DShooterProject
Small Unity project where I try to recreate a game clone of common top down 2D shooters.

### Game controllers/mechanics (updates as more is added)
Use arrow keys or "WASD" to move around (also works with controllers). Left click to shoot and left shift key to run, current stamina and health is represented by the red/white bar on the map.

### How to run
Open "Latest build" then run "2DShooterProj.exe"

### Completed
- Health bar
- Stamina bar
- Camera movement

### In progress
- Enemies
- Exit game

### TODO (update as more things gets added)
- Replace cubes/spheres with sprites
- Design first level
- Get sprites for my walls/floor etc.
- Enemy pathfinding
- Main menu
- Pause menu
- First level
- Boss mechanics (health bar/special ability?)
